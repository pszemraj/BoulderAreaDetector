# BoulderAreaDetector

Deploys a deep learning CNN classifying satellite imagery to [streamlit](https://share.streamlit.io/pszemraj/boulderareadetector) for user testing. The app is an MVP demo of GeoNatureDiscoverer (more info to be released.. TBD). The original idea for GeoNatureDiscoverer originated in the June
2021 CASSINI Hackathon, that repo is [here](https://github.com/JonathanLehner/cassini_2021_nature_discoverer).

An example of model predictions on a holdout set:

## Model Stats - CNN Classifier

In short, the predictor under-the-hood is: fastai library using a convolutional neural network 
trained on a labeled dataset of several thousand images with two classes (climb_area, other). 
Source image data for training is mostly arial (possibly some satellite) sampled from Switzerland.

**Note: the model deployed in the streamlit app has changed.** the original model used in this app
was [ResNet101](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385) and the trained model file is ~170 MB. As GitHub
has limits / special rules around files greater than 100 mb in size, the model has been updated
to [MixNet-XL](https://paperswithcode.com/method/mixconv), which exhibits similar performance but is
smaller (in parameters, and therefore file size).
> Also included in the repo is a zipped model file of a trained [Big Transfer model](https://paperswithcode.com/lib/timm/big-transfer) that is more accurate than either of the 
> two. As this model is > 100 mb and streamlit unzipping+predicting performance is yet to be 
> tested, it is not deployed to the app yet, but can be used locally.

A decent writeup on how to create, train, and save a fastai computer vision model is
in [this Medium article](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/understanding-fastai-v2-training-with-a-computer-vision-example-part-1-the-resnet-model-dd9270450bb8). BoulderAreaDetector uses a decently
sized labeled dataset (several thousand satellite images, each 256x256 in the two classes), but has
not had any significant level of hyperparameter optimization yet beyond fast. ai basics.

### Details on Original ResNet101 Fine-Tuned Model

This was the original model that was replaced as the file size was too large.

- [ResNet101](https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/_modules/torchvision/models/resnet.html#resnet101)
- package: fast.ai (pytorch)
- trained for 20 epochs
- Loss:  FlattenedLoss of CrossEntropyLoss()
- Optimizer: Adam
